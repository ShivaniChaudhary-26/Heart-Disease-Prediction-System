# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
This project uses a trained machine learning model to analyze medical features and predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease. The web interface allows users to input parameters and receive instant feedback.

 # Featues
- 🩺 Predict the presence of heart disease
- 📊 Input medical parameters via a web form
- 🔍 View prediction results instantly
- 💾 Trained ML model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM)
- 🌐 Interactive UI using Flask or Streamlit

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn – ML model training and evaluation
- Pandas & NumPy – Data preprocessing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization (optional)
- Flask or Streamlit – Web app interface
- HTML/CSS – Frontend design
